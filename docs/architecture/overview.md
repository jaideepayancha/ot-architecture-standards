# SCADA & OT Architecture Standards Overview

Welcome to the Enterprise Standards for Industrial Automation, SCADA, IIoT, and OT Cybersecurity.

## Purpose

These standards provide a unified framework for designing, implementing, and maintaining Operational Technology (OT) systems across all manufacturing and processing facilities. By adhering to these standards, we ensure:

- **Security**: Robust protection against cyber threats using the Defense in Depth strategy.
- **Reliability**: High availability and redundancy for critical production systems.
- **Scalability**: A modular architecture that grows with the enterprise.
- **Interoperability**: Seamless data integration between the plant floor and enterprise systems.

## Key Components

### [Core Architecture](../architecture/overview.md)
Based on the **Purdue Model**, defining the network levels and segmentation principles required for secure OT operations.

### [SCADA & Ignition](../scada/ignition-standards.md)
Detailed standards for deploying Ignition by Inductive Automation, including gateway configurations, redundancy, and project structures.

### [IIoT & Data Strategy](../iiot/edge-gateways.md)
Standards for data collection using Edge Gateways and transport via **MQTT Sparkplug B**.

### [OT Cybersecurity](../security/identity-access.md)
Policies and technical controls for identity management, patching, and incident response following **ISA/IEC 62443**.

## Target Audience

- **Control Engineers**: For designing and implementing site-level systems.
- **IT Professionals**: For understanding OT-specific requirements and integration patterns.
- **Vendor Partners**: For ensuring third-party solutions comply with enterprise requirements.
